# javascript-challenge

Just a quick note on my bonus question's answer, Julia already mentioned it is not a good practice, but she challenged me to try if it was working.

I let it like that as it worked. She explained me the other approaches (dropdown menu and "waterfall" type filter), but I won't have time to change my solution.
